# Moncherz
I want to know when theres gonna be cheesecake in the dining hall
Checking the menu website myself is too much work, so I'm making an android app that does it for me :)
It will grab the html source of the menu webpage for a given day and hall, parse it with Regex, and send a notification for which places have foods I have starred as "favorites"


Icons that weren't in there by default from Android Studio are from http://materialdesignicons.com/

Some code gotten from these helpful pages
